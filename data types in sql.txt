data types in sql 

the type of data which is store in each fied is called data type


types
1) number data type 
   a)int
   b) float


2) text data type
   a) char : it is fix length of character (max 255 length) 
   b) varchar: it is variable length of character ( max 65535) 

varchar is helps to reduce data storage because if we mention varchar(20) character but we write only 10 character that time it take only 10 place
but char is fix length if we write char(10) we write 5 character remaining empty 5 spaces is also consider  
so when we know fix length that time we used char
when we don't know fix length we used varchar

3) time
   a) date
   b) time
   c) date and time
   d) date stop : it helps to get auto current date and time @ any time
